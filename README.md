# Flappy-s-Cousin-Box-Bird-
remake/retake on flappy bird 2-d game
None of the materials are my original work.
I became interested in practicing some JS through game development, 
and I stumbled across this awesome tutorial for a flappy Bird clone, 
by Thomas Palef, his website lessmilk.com.
I chose to start here because the game I would like to create will utilize Phaser, and sprite animation.
And after seeing his work and fun games I thought it would be great practice to soon acheive my own game vision.

The current stage of this game, it is playable but super basic.
I am still working on finding an assigning more audio, images, and action.
